# Kaggle-Community-30-Days-of-ML


https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/30-days-of-ml

For the final two weeks of the program, you will work on this competition, open only to people who have signed up for the 30 Days of ML program.


As part of the program, you will complete three courses: 
- Python, 
- Intro to Machine Learning, and 
- Intermediate Machine Learning.

### About the data
The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic (and generated using a CTGAN), but based on a real dataset. The original dataset deals with predicting the amount of an insurance claim. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.

### How to spend the next two weeks: keep learning!

**Aim to make at least one submission per day**. 

**Even if you are low on time, you can learn a lot from this exercise, and it is very motivating to gradually move up the leaderboard!**

As described in the Getting Started Guide above, the best way to keep learning from the community is through the Discussion tab and Code tab above.

- Through the Discussion tab, you can chat with users about ideas or doubts that you have, or find a team to work with.
- Through the Code tab, you can share your code and also learn from code that other Kagglers have shared with the community.

If you're interested in learning new skills through courses, check out the Intro to Deep Learning and Feature Engineering courses, which teach new techniques that could be relevant for working with the competition data.

The data for this competition is closely related to the Tabular Playground Series - Feb 2021 competition. Refer to the Code tab and the Discussion tab for ideas of algorithms that you might like to try, that may also perform well in this competition!

### Dataset Description
For this competition, you will be predicting a continuous target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. All of the feature columns, cat0 - cat9 are categorical, and the feature columns cont0 - cont13 are continuous.

### Files
- **train.csv** - the training data with the target column
- **test.csv** - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format
